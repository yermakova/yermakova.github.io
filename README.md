Changes being that I made it jekyll ready and smushed the CSS together.


### Adjustments

1. Added the categories button, but still need to make it stick to the top once I scroll past it
2. Want to add all the categories back once I click the categories button
3. but first, I need to actually implement the categories
4. need to hide the drop down and show it again on a card click
