# Hi, I'm Val Yermakova.

I use this blog to document random thoughts I have.

My favorite discussions topics include:
* Psycology and neuroscience
* Biology and chemistry (worked in a melanoma lab)
* International politics, particularly of Asian countries (cumulatively have spent years writing papers on Asian policies)
* Environmental science (I really like trees)

I'm also into athletics. Circus tricks and handstands are the current obsession.
