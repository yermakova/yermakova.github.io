##### Something I tell myself everyday.

Go. Just go and do. Seriously, right now. Go and do. When you stop moving, when you stop trying, then you stop learning. And if you stop learning, what’s the point of living? When life becomes the same, day after day, then you’ve stopped living.

##### What the heck do I mean?

> “Eh, I feel lazy”
> “The people there will be lame anyways”
> “I just don’t feel like it”
> “But…Netflix”
> “I would have to put on pants”
> “There is nothing to do, I’m so bored”
> “It’s going to be awkward, I don’t know anyone”

Sound familiar?

It’s so easy to stay in, to stay in whatever zone you’re currently in. Mustering up the energy to leave that zone is hard. But there is so much in the world to see and do that if you just get off your butt and put those pants on, you’ll see how incredible it is. You should never be bored because the world has so much to offer.
Whenever I encounter an opportunity for something weird or different and it would just be way easier for me to chill at home, I force myself to go. And I almost never regret it. Because I’m always forcing myself to go to places and do things, not all of them end up being awesome. But that’s bound to happen. If I have the habit of “going and doing” for every lame event there’s going to be ten good ones and three incredible ones. You literally NEVER know what’s going to happen, who you’re going to meet and what you’re going to learn.

There’s also a huge difference between informational learning (facts and ideas from books, lectures, media) and experiential learning (relationships and distinctions discovered through testing your assumptions).

I took this very weird theater class at Berkeley where essentially we spent 3 hours lying on the ground, moving a single body part. Technically it’s called the Feldenkrais Method. I wasn’t a big fan, but I was also a freshman - maybe I wasn’t ready to understand the value of moving my head slowly from side to side for 15 minutes. Anyways, we had readings and I remember one quote that I liked:

*“Most of our learning is informational - facts and idea that we take in through books, lectures, and other media, where we listen to someone else tell us what we should know and understand.*

Real learning, the kind we all experienced as children, comes from our ability to make distinctions and crease new relationships to the world we live in. Through this kind of learning, we can develop a sense of self based on an internal criteria and an inner authority.”
Staying home and watching Netflix, or whatever it is you do at home alone (I don’t judge), you know what’s going to happen. You know what to expect and your expectations will come true. You will gain +1 comfort points for relaxing but +0 points for learning and growing. I aim to always choose learning+growth over comfort. Especially since I’m only 22 at the time of this post, I’ve got old age to try and be comfortable. Although I hope even when I’m old I never grow complacent. Complacency seems like such a sad way to live life.
