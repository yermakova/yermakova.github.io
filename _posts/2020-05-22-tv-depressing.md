Random thought I had last night. Why is it depressing to see a person staring at a TV? What about it feels so sad?

Here’s my theory. It’s because that TV-watcher-person is displaying a lack of control and empowerment. That TV-watcher-person is, in fact, being controlled. And humans are inspired by action, by a state of empowerment. Humans are inspired by the ability to control and influence. When you are being controlled by the TV, it’s like your life isn’t your own and that feels sad.
