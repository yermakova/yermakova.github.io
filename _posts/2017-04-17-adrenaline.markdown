# Focus 

Going on adventures; diving, flying, falling from the sky, surfing, snow-boarding, hiking, camping, climbing, handstand-ing on top of mountains, these things all bring an incredible sense of focus. Much like meditation is difficult and frustrating at first, seeking adventures isn't always easy but the outcome is always worth the effort. 

That sense of focus gives purpose "don't crash" or "stay upright" makes you feel incredible because all the side chatter of day to day life just dissapears. Sure meditating is 'safer' with substantially less risk of your neck snapping (although who knows in Califorina - we are very overdue for a crazy earthquake), but it's tough to replace the feeling of "CONCENCRATE VAL, YOUR LIFE MAY END AND IF YOU DIE YOUR MOM WILL KILL YOU SO DO NOT DIE"
