### Yes
I mean, if you read the news you'll learn about plenty of sketchy things.

Knowing that it wasn't going to be exactly Switzerland, I prepared ahead of time. I had only a single backpack, no jewelry (which included taking out my many earrings), and secret ways to hide my money and passport in various parts of my clothing. I only took my phone out in safe places (national parks, inside banks with guards, etc) I also didn't wear any fancy clothes or anything that would draw attention to me and I *always* had my passport plastered to my body via a pocket my mom sewed into my sports bra. I'll go in detail about minimalist packing in another post though. In addition I carried a 'fake' phone and 'fake' wallet. It was some ancient Nokia I found in my parent's house and a wallet with just a few small bills in it. That way if I got robbed I would have something to give to make them go away.

I've been to Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Argentina, so those are the only ones I can talk about. 

My friends in those countries (as well as the locals I met living in that region) all told me each of those countries is dangerous. It seemed like everyone had a story of them or someone close to them being robbed on a bus or in a park. 

### No

I spent a month there and nothing sketchy ever happened. Excluding, of course, the transportation. That is legit incredibly dangerous because they drive with pickup trucks packed full of people and on crazy windy rocky roads. While I definitely recommend people to visit Central America, I *do not* recommend you bring children. I saw several parents there with their kids but man, if I had kids, I would not take them there. The transportation system is a death trap.

However I was never robbed or felt threatened in any way. I never saw a bus being stopped or any guns at all actually. But that may be because I purposefully opted to only take day time buses (not overnight ones) and I was extra aware. But keeping that in mind, I also overheard a European who'd been traveling Central America for a while talk about how much he loves overnight buses because you save on a night of sleep. So I'm guessing nothing bad happened to him thus far. 

I saw gang graffiti, but nothing more than you would see around the Bay Area in California.

Also while I was on the local buses transporting from one city to another, I had out my iPhone and was watching downloaded episodes of Netflix. In retrospect that wasn't the smartest idea, I wouldn't do it again. Or at the very least, I would make sure to sit at the very back of the bus so that no one else could see. 

One of my friends from El Salvador also told me rumors of how the gangs don't bother tourists because the gangs are all buddy-buddy with the government and the government needs tourist money. That's unverified so **absolutely do not** consider yourself safe because of that, but it was an interesting thought. 

In summary, go and visit Central America but prepare ahead of time. Don't flaut your belongings out for everyone to see and ask friendly locals about no-go zones. You don't want to find yourself in the middle of a turfwar.
