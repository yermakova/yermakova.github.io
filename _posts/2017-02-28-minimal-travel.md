# How to pack & do bug repellent correctly

##### Packing light is incredible.

Seriously, having less stuff to schlep around makes a trip 10x better. Especially if you like to stay flexible and go on adventures instead of planning everything ahead of time (not that there is anything wrong with planning).

Below I will post my full packing list of what I brought in a single 32L backpack for one month through Central America. This bag could have lasted me forever though, just with washes every two weeks.

Also, a key to my succesful packing was the ideal packing ‘cube’. I couldn’t find any on the market that didn’t take up a ton of space and was affordable. Eagle Creek has some really nice looking ones if you want to shell out $40 or so, but that was a bit steep for a little bag for me. So instead my mom made me some out of mesh fabric I bought.

Another key to this trip is that the whole time I was between 45 - 85 degree weather (7 to 30 degrees Celcius). So I had things to layer but nothing to withstand a European winter.

##### How to get in, get around and not be stranded with a disease

> Step 1: Visas, Vaccines, Weather, Insurance, Transportation

**Visas:** For American citizens, you don’t have to worry about visas to most places in the America’s

**Vaccines:** For American citizens, not really a whole lot to worry about. You need the standard Hep B/C vaccines but you should have gotten those anyways. Ones to consider are Yellow Fever (not required for places I’m going), Rabies (not required for me because I won’t be around animals).

**Weather:** Check out what average weather you will be in store for. 70 degree average? Great, but don’t forget that mountainous regions are colder and evenings can be balmy. Essentially, this means bring layers.

**Transportation:** Do some research beforehand. To be on the safe side in Central America you should avoid taking the cheaper chicken buses because they are known to be stopped and raided in the middle of the journey. Also avoid traveling on long bus rides at night, I’ve read stories of those being stopped by gangsters looking to rob passengers as well.

**Insurance:** Travel insurance is cheap and a good idea. Typically I hate insurance policies because they are a rip off. But in this case, there are some great companies that offer very good and very affordable plans. Especially when you’re going to developing countries, it’s just a good call. Personally I used GeoBlue.

##### Don’t get Zika/Plague

> Step 2: Mosquito/Bug Preparation

This is crucial and there’s a smart way to do it. Personally I would really not like malaria, yellow fever, Zika or whatever other plague mosquitos carry, so I’ve done a lot of research.

###### Part 1: Clothing

Yes, you should spray your clothes. No, the stuff that you spray on your body does not work on your clothes.
For clothes use Permethrin. For body, use DEET or Picaridin. This is because the Permethrin actually kills the bugs. DEET and anything else for your body merely masks your body. So on DEET, etc, you are invisible to most insects. On Permethrin you are literally death to them.
But don’t put it on your body. Not a great idea to put stuff that kills other stuff on your largest organ.
The hack is to make sure you use the Permethrin for clothes. You spray it all over you clothes, let it dry, spray it again, let it dry, spray it a third time and let it dry a third time. After that you iron the clothes to make sure the chemicals are stuck in there and then you’re good to go for about 70 washes! This is essentially the same exact thing that companies who sell insect-repellent clothing do.

###### Part 2: Body

REI sells a cream and a spray, both carry-on compliant. I got both in my eagerness to protect myself, but it was too much. One bottle of spray or cream is enough for a month because I wasn’t always in mosquito territory.
**IMPORTANT:** Do not pull the insect repellant out of your bag for airport security to check. They will say it’s ‘toxic’ and can’t be taken on the flight and they will confiscate it. I’ve only had this issue on flights to developing countries. American TSA has never commented on it. Just leave your liquids in your bag, as long as they meet the requirements.

##### Have stuff

> Step 3: Packing Clothes

The goal here is to pack clothes that are super durable and don’t get stinky fast. Cotton, polyester, etc all get smelly quickly. The key here is to get merino wool. It’s annoyingly expensive, but it’s worth it. You can wear the same shirt for days if not weeks (sweating in it etc) and it doesn’t smell at all.

The below list is for a female, but honestly the male version is the same excluding a dress, hair ties and the diva cup…although if you like those, more power to you.

**Tops**
- long sleeve merino wool shirt
- merino wool t-shirt
- tank top (x2)
- sleeping shirt (I like a silk one, cotton gets too stinky too fast)
- light jacket for layering
- light rain jacket/windbreaker
- sports bras (x2)

**Bottoms**
- sleeping pants (I use elephant pants from Thailand)
- high quality, quick dry hiking pants
- high quality leggings
- underwear (x12)

**Other**
- light dress
- swimsuit
- visor/hat

**Feet**
- running/hiking/walking shoes
- sandals
- meriono wool socks x5 (trust me it’s a game changer, especially if you get stinky feet like I do)

> Step 3: Packing Everything That’s Not Clothes

![Secret passport pocket](/images/posts/passport-bra.jpg)

**Sanitation**
- microfiber towel (a small one will do, especially if you’re traveling somewhere warm)
- diva cup
- hand sanitizer
- razor
- toothbrush
- toothpaste
- mini shampoo and soap
- deodorant
- chapstick
- hair ties, bobby pins

**Safety/Protection**
- anti-diarrhea pills
- sunglasses
- sunblock
- pepper spray
- photocopies of credit cards and passport (hidden in different places)
- fake phone
- fake wallet (with small money in it)
- rain cover for backpack (I had one from a 40L bag that I got, it’s not neceassry but highly recommended if you’re going to be walking through rain and don’t want everything in your bag soaked)
- money belt (I use a flat Eagle Creek on that I love. Convenient in the airport to put your passport in there and then during the day to hide your money. During the day I never keep my passport in there, it’s always in the pocket that my mom sewed into my sports bras)
- bug spray **see above about how to do it right
- as a matter of personal preference, I also keep my passport in a waterproof vinyl cover (purchased on eBay for like $3) because otherwise it would wear out too quickly and could get water damaged

**Lifestyle**
- travel pillow (for long bus rides, I used an inflatable one)
- eyemask
- ear plugs
- headphones (x2)
- daybag (I use an REI 18L flashpack)
- waterproof blue bag (I use from the SeaToSummit brand, really great and useful to protect your stuff in)
- cheap water bottle (if you lose it, whatever, but have it to add water into instead of buying water everyday)
- plastic bags (I roll these up super small and attach them to my daypack. Super useful for carrying things like dirty clothes, wet things, trash, etc)
- padlock (if you’re staying in hostels, lock up your bag)
- headlamp
- laundry detergent sheets (bring like 3 and just throw them into your clothes compartment of your bag, keeps things smelling good)
- tissues
- $1 and $5 bills (most countries accept USD in case of emergency for a cab right or something)
- spork
- pens (x2)
- rubber bands (Also attached to my day pack and normal backpack. Super useful for tying up things, fastening things, holding stuff together, etc)
- journal (write about your daily adventures!)

![Secret passport pocket](/images/posts/rubber-band.jpg)

**Tech**
- real phone
- phone charger (cable and USB port)
- adapters (if you need it, for Central America I didn’t need one)
- iPod (I like this for long bus rides, when you don’t want to drain your phone battery but want to listen to music for hours)
- iPod charger
- portable charger and charging cable (I never want to be without a phone in case of emergency, so I always keep a portable charger with me in case it dies)

## And yes this all fit in my 32L backpack!
