## Online security is all the rage nowadays because no one wants to get hacked, but most normal people don't know even the basic stuff, so I want to help out.

#### [Google's Safe Browsing](https://safebrowsing.google.com/) team has lots of great online resources if you want to learn more. This post will give an overview of what security issues exist nowadays in a way a non-tech person can absorb.

**Is this webpage secure?**

There are three types of URL's

A: ![A](http://i.imgur.com/mQKkg4X.png)

B: ![B](http://i.imgur.com/Vm5GbUr.png)

C: ![C](http://i.imgur.com/VKL4wKH.png)

**What does 'secure' mean?**

It's talking about something called HTTPS (HyperTech Transfer Protocol over SSL) and SSL (Secure Socket Layer). So if something looks like example C, it means that the data is not encrypted. It's only HTTP, sans the 'S'. This means that if you enter information on a C site then the information you enter is vulnerable to having a third party read it. **This means that you should never enter any sensitive information (passwords, bank account details, address, non-junk email) on a C site.**

*What the heck is this HTTPS/HTTP stuff? Check the URL of any page you're on. For example: http://ecocult.com/. This is a webpage for helping you find which companies don't use slave labor and in general have ethical manufacturing practices. It's http, which means it's fine to browse, but don't enter sensitive information on it.* 

But Val your website doesn't have the security verification. Yeah, there's no need because I'm not asking you for any information and I don't serve ads. Most bloggers don't have secure sites, even [Tim Ferris](http://tim.blog/ "Tim Ferris' Blog Page") (who's got something like 100+ million podcast downloads and who I highly recommend) doesn't have his page encrypted. So if it's not encyrpted with SSL don't freak out, but do be extra wary of entering information.

**Types of URLs**

Type A: (AKA: HTTPS EV Certificates) Encrypted over SSL *and* verfied. So if it looks like A then the URL you are visiting is not only encrypted but guaranteed to indeed be the company or organization it claims to be. 

Type B: (AKA: HTTPS DV & OV Certificates) Encrypted over SSL. (AKA: your information is protected)

Type C: (AKA: HTTP) No encryption, no certificate to prove it's secure.


So is type A better than type B? Eh, inconclusive. It's more expensive to get A certifcation and adds a layer of security, but only companies can really get the HTTPS EV status. 

Am I 100% safe if I see a A or B URL? No. Always be aware on the internet for anything that looks funky.

### Types of hacks?

I'm wary of making this post too long, so I'll give the basic breakdown. The internet is your friend for more details. Or you can just ask me too.

In general they are often classified as either Malware, Unwanted Software, and Phising.

**Malware**: It gets downloaded onto your machine (computer/tablet/phone) and takes control. Your machine and all the information on it is not at the mercy of whoever is behind the Malware. It can purely steal information like bank credentials or it can also turn your machine into a bot. That means, unbeknown to you, your machine is clicking on all sorts of ads to generate revenue, or performing some other illicit activity. You don't know it's happening because you don't see it. It's done with hidden browser windows.

**Unwanted Software**: Typically not quite as bad as malware, but still not good. Usually it's downloaded in a bundle with something legitimate and it difficult to remove. It can transmit and collect your personal info and hides in other software that you've downloaded.

**Phising (Scam)**: The example everyone recognizes is the Nigerian Prince promising you gold and riches if you just give him a small loan to escape his country. But Phising is literally doing anything that tricks you into entering your information into an inproper source. Creating a fake webpage that looks just like Paypal's login page, having you login and then being redirected to the real login page again is a dead giveaway your information has been compromised. **So make sure you double check the URL before entering any information to make sure it's the one you intended to have**


### How can I tell I've been hacked?

Here's a [list](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2612634/security/security-11-sure-signs-you-ve-been-hacked.html?page=1) of things to watch out for:

1. Fake antivirus messages
2. Unwanted browser toolbars: if there's something you don't recoginize in your browser toolbar, delete it. 
3. Your internet searches are being redirected to some random search engine
4. Tons of pop-ups
5. Your online passwords suddently change
6. People are receieved fake emails from your account
7. Unexpected software installs
8. Your cursor moves on its own
9. Your legitmate antimalware and antivirus software is disabled


Here's a video from Google's Safe Browsing team telling you what to do if you've been hacked:
