Here's what I've found from reading posts and papers from sources that seemed credible (ie; no Yahoo Answers or 'Healthy Homeopathic Website'-like posts). I tried really hard to find answers that were paired with peer-reviewed science. 

### Microwave != Radiation

Important difference to note. Radiation occurs via gamma ray penetration, the same waves associated with nuclear reactions. Microwaves (the waves themselves, not the machines) have less energy than even visible light. This means that they cannot ionize molecules (aka: your DNA) and cannot cause cancer. The magnetron is "tuned away from the resonance, so that it can penetrate into the middle of the item". This causes the water molecules to move around (because they are polar and the microwave machine used a magnet) and that makes heat. This is why tomatoes or blueberries would get disproportionately hot in a microwave. They have more water content. Dried mushrooms, on the hand, will barely heat up at all.
 
### Should I wait until the 3 beeps are done?

If you overrode the interlock system and used the microwave machine with the door open, yeah, bad things will happen. 

However the doors are super protective and even the little glass door you can see through is way too small for microwaves (the actual waves) to pass through.

Every (as far as I could tell, legit) microwave scientist I encountered on the internet said there's no way you could get any damage from opening the microwave early.

However, it should be noted that repeatedly opening the microwave early will cause damage to the machine itself. This is because everytime you open it early (without pressing the off button) you trigger all sorts of switches and drain the power in a way that the machine isn't designed to do repeatedly.

So overall, by the time you open it, the microwaves are all gone and you're fine. Even if you open before the 3 beeps. In fact, if you press the 'Stop' button before the timer is done, you don't hear the 3 beeps and you can still take the food out. The 3 beeps are to notify you that the food is done, not to make you wait.

*** But be careful because if the door is stuck or doesn't close fully and isn't sealed in someway, then that can be really dangerous ***
