Here’s something I wrote in a blog about 4 years ago that I still use:

Ever feel like you’re not doing anything with your life, like you’re living in a nebulous realm? I used to. Constantly I would think “What have I really done? What do I want to do? Where is my life heading? Will I be happy in the future?!”
To fix this annoying existential crisis I made a chart.
Every single week, on Sunday nights, I evaluate my progress in 6 areas.

|   |Important Thing | What I Accomplished  | What I Failed At  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  Family |   |   |   |   |
|  Friends |   |   |   |   |
|  Education |   |   |   |   |
|  Career |   |   |   |   |
|  Health |   |   |   |   |
|  Other |   |   |   |   |

This is an unavoidable, absolutely mandatory event every single week.
So far it’s been working out great. I feel far more satisfaction from life because I can very tangibly evaluate my progress and my failures.
I highly recommend doing this - I spend about 30 min on it. And honestly it’s pretty fun to do once you get started.
