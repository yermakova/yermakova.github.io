Here's something I wrote in a blog about 4 years ago that I still use:

Ever feel like you're not doing anything with your life, like you're living in a nebulous realm?
I used to. Constantly I would think "What have I really done? What do I want to do? Where is my life heading? Will I be happy in the future?!" 

To fix this annoying existential crisis I made a chart.

Every single week, on Sunday nights, I evaluate my progress in 6 areas. 

<html>
<head>
<style>
table, th, td {
    border: 1px solid black;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Important Thing</th>
    <th>What I Accomplished</th> 
    <th>What I Failed At</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Family</td>
	<td> </td>
	<td> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Friends</td>
	<td> </td>
	<td> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Education</td>
	<td> </td>
	<td> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Career</td>
	<td> </td>
	<td> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Health</td>
	<td> </td>
	<td> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Other</td>
	<td> </td>
	<td> </td>
  </tr>
</table>

</body>
</html>

This is an unavoidable, absolutely mandatory event every single week.

So far it's been working out great. I feel far more satisfaction from life because I can very tangibly evaluate my progress and my failures.

I highly recommend doing this - I spend about 30 min on it. And honestly it's pretty fun to do once you get started.
