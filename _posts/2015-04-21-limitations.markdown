### Dolor sit amet?
Just read a great blog post on HELLO, My Name is Blog and it really resonated. 
Here's a quote taken from there that referred to a cancer patient speaking to their doctor.   

*“If you have a bad attitude about your disease, odds are, you won’t get better­­, because you won’t do the necessary research on the resources that will make you better. You’ll never find the solution that leads to the solution. That’s the physical and procedural manifestation of a bad attitude. Mindset may not affect the outcome, but it does affect the experience.”*

I recommend a read for sure.
