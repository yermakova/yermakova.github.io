##### The government supported American Dream of home-ownership was incredibly myopic 

> People don’t question that buying a home is a good thing, it’s just something they’ve always been told and now assume to be true

After WWII the US has a bunch of programs to incentivize home-ownership. This resulted in, you guessed it, a bunch more home-ownership.

The problem with this was that once people got their homes, they became really adamant about maximizing the growth of their property value retaining their small-town feel. You can’t blame them, anyone would want that. However, the population kept growing and high-density areas (cities) became even higher density.

So now we are stuck with a bunch of homeowners that fight all legislation to “build up” and have taller buildings with apartment complexes. This limits the supply of housing and pushes housing prices astronomically high.

Welcome the Millenial generation who have no affordable homes to live in.
