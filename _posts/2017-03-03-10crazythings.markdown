# Did it do anything?

Yeah, definitely. The experiment was meant to last for only 3 days but today is the third and I'm going to keep going. 10 ideas takes a bit too much time, but I'm doing to make 5 ideas a daily practice.

Why?

Because I found that after thinking of these ideas, new ones would come much more naturally to me - without even trying. When I was sitting on bart (the metro system in the Bay Area, California) for example, instead of just sitting there and thinking about how lame Bay Area mass transit is compared to Europe or Asia, I started thinking of solutions. I didn't force myself to do that, it's like my brain just naturally thought of ways to make it better.

So even doing this for such a short period of time made an improvement in my thinking.

# Here are my ideas

**Day 1:**

1. Having personal robots that can fly and that look like dragons so you could 'fly' a dragon
2. Having pictures printed on paper actually be printed on paper made of computer chips, so that images would be like gifs. Cool or just annoying? Because having a moving thing in your peripheral can be annoying
3. Mandating that all products be easily recyclable (for example having the paper wrapping on bottles be able to be taken off very easily)
4. Edible tooth cleaning bacteria. Would be cool to engineer some bacteria that you just throw into your mouth, they get going to clean every little bit of plaque and then you can just swallow them for extra protein :)
5. Plastic surgeon's offering Wolvernine surgery, where you can get retractable claws put in
6. Bathroom mirrors in inbedded cancer sensors that you can breath into every morning and they will let you know if you've got any signs of at least the 50% of cancers and 16 other diseases that can be [detected via breath](https://www.engadget.com/2016/12/29/simple-breath-test-can-detect-cancer-and-16-other-diseases/)
7. Having Professor Xavier's mind reading ability to perfectly match people looking to sell and looking to buy something. Like if you want to sell your bike and you put it on craigslist there's no guarantee that the person in the world who wants it will run into it
8. Unlocking the secret to subconscious learning. Meaning we reach the point where we can channel information in the appropriate medium for our brains to absorb while we are sleeping
9. There's dog whisperers and stuff, so does that mean there are tree whisperers? Does talking to a plant work, does it react in any way? What if there are people out there who really have the power to make plants grow faster just via their energy
10. For it to be illegal to not vaccinate your kid - also that all convicted anti-vax-ers would be forced to read peer reviewed science as their pushiment

**Day 2:**

1. Bicycles that can't fall over if hit
2. Fingerprint scanners that understand if you're conscious or not (that way someone can't kill you or drug you just to get access to your phone/laptop with your fingerprint)
3. Lanes on road to have sensors underneath so that a GPS device can read it and know which lane you are in (so it doesn't tell you to exit immediately when you are five lanes from the exit)
4. Phones that could turn into mini-copters to fly to some short distance, all you gatta do it hold on
5. All clothing companies in the world would have to show authentic pictures of videos of the working conditions of their laborers on tags on clothing
6. Metro trains that have one main track and then pods that branch off to cover more ground. So for example, a line that runs from Berkeley to San Francisco but, depending on the destination of the users, a pod will break off at certain points to pursue a different road without forcing everyone else on board to go to the stop as well. After the pod takes the person to their destination, it returns and attaches onto the main train
7. Everyone in the world understanding that alcohol and cigarettes are two of the most dangerous drugs and the laws are formed not via pure intentions (cannabis can cause harm to people so ban it) but also with power-gaining intentions (immigrants from Mexico use a lot of cannabis, if we ban it we can jail them) I'm not saying go out and smoke weed, I just think people should understand that intentions behind laws aren't always what they seem
8. The ability to shrink and resize things. Amazing for travel especially, and for storing goods that you only need once a year (Christmas decorations, etc)
9. Finding other life forms in outer space that we can communicate with, wow that'd be incredible
10. Tupperware that would never get separated from it's lid

**Day 3:**

1. Batteries that charged with body heat (aka: laptop that charge by sitting on your lap or by having your hands rest on them)
2. Houses built out of nanobots that can change shape into whatever you want
3. Pipes that would never clog because they are coated with trash eatting, non-toxic, bacteria
4. Catching stormwater with drones and nets in one place and sending it to another that has a draught 
5. Treating all animals like we would treat a dog, as a senient being with emotions like love and fear (although not petting all of them like we would a dog...probably best not to try to pet a Hippo)
6. Allowing every society to contruct itself whatever way it wants (relgious, atheist, capitalist, socialist, gender nuetral or strict gender binaries) and then letting people choose where they want to go, allowing them to move freely but never allowing them to try and implement their norms in another place. The key here is that anyone can change worlds at any point with no repercussions. They could sell their belongings and house in one society and be able to buy it in another. People could take a test to see where their opinions lie and then they would be suggested a society. 
7. Stem cell shots that automatically fix all broken bones and ligaments
8. Tennis balls that don't deflate
9. A smart watch that can read you body's hormone levels, heart rate and perspiration rate and some other stuff to determine your emotional status. This can be used to help train yourself to control your emotions (for example, people who get bad stage fright or who freak out when presenting)
10. A President and political leaders who actually understand the gravity of the environmental catastrophy we are in. We need more scientists in office
