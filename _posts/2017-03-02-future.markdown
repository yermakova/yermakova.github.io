### **Walls**

Soon chips will cost pennies and putting up a wallpaper made of paper or made of computer chips won't differ much in price, if at all. When we reach this point, our walls will come alive. We will be able to not only transform our walls into 'screen savers' or images of beautiful locations, but we will be able to talk to them. At family gatherings we will be able to unite family that is spread around the world by video calling them with our walls. As we celebrate with our dinner we can be "with" them as they eat their own.

Our walls could also be our doctor. When AI gets good enough we will be able to tell our symptoms to our wall and it will be able to diagnose ~95% of problems. Should we need future assitance it will book a doctor's appointment for us. This is incredible not only for time saving purposes but also for elderly, people with young children and people who are just really sick and can't physcially make it to a hospital.

### **Paper**

So stoked about this because I'm all about minimal stuff and efficient useage of space. Apple is already planning on releasing it's new $1k phone with an OLED screen and Samsung is planning on launching a [foldable phone](https://www.engadget.com/2017/01/12/samsung-and-lg-could-launch-foldable-phones-later-this-year/) this year. Yeah, mind blowing. Imagine being able to roll up your laptop or phone when you're on-the-go. With OLED's becoming more widespread we will likely see paper become smart. Blueprints, textbooks, notebooks, computers, everything will be able to be on a single sheet of rollable 'paper'. 

### **Biometrics** 

I'm a little obsessed with fitness and body metrics so this makes me feel like:

I dream about the day when I will be able to monitor the chemical compostition of everything I ingest and test is against what's optimal for my body health. 

One of my biggest pet peeves is when people make claims about the metabolism (eat smaller meals throughout the day, make sure to eat breakfast, etc) when I know they know nothing about it since the scientific community as a whole knows barely anything about it. Even cutting edge research on stuff like [mTOR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4128044/) sounds incredible, but then you realize it's got a nasty side and some bodies degrade faster with higher levels of mTOR. Also everybody responds differently. To maintain good health and a good weight some people should eat breakfast and some people shouldn't. You can't just make a blanket statement that 'breakfast is the most important meal of the day'.

But if we could do complete genetic sequencing and monitoring of chemical intake, we could theoretically optimize *everything*.

If you then incorporate that into internet connected contact lenses or glasses that let me know 'hey Val, broccoli is a no-go for you, but try brussel sprouts' everytime I go to Trader Joe's, it would be incredible and lifechanging.

There are obvious security issues and threats with all of this. This is a lot of information that a computer is going to be holding. And I don't want anyone to have access to my health data as much as the next person, but with proper security measures, wow these innovations would be spectacular. 

Check out this super cool company that makes a handheld, commercially available (although expensive) chemical composition detector: [SCiO](https://www.consumerphysics.com/myscio/scio/).


## Further Reading

Michio Kaku has a great and well researched booked called ['Physics of the Future'](https://www.amazon.com/Physics-Future-Science-Shape-Destiny/dp/0307473333) that I highly recommend.

He talks about how when TV came out everyone lamented the death of Theatre. When DVD's came out, that was the end of live music and even when phones came out people cried that it would be the final blow to human face-to-face connection. Of course none of that happened. It's because we are cavemen at heart. We still hold great value to physcial connection and presence. That's why people shell out hundreds of dollars for concerts or sports games when they could just watch it for free at home. Or why people wait in line for hours for a celebrity signature when they could just download one online. 

These factors of human nature are crucial to consider when predicting what tech the future will hold. Kaku's argument is that that demand for real human interaction won't dissapear anytime soon. This is because being immersed in a concert is infinitely times better than, for example, asking Alexa to play the Beyonce Pandora station.
